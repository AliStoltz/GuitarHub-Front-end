## User Story

* Without an account you can browse the site and see what posting are availible. The posts will simply have a picture of the guitar for sale and the price, but no further details or the ability to add it to a cart. Creating an account allows you to post guitars, shop for guitars and keep track of your buying history. There will be a filter section availible to refine your search. As a stretch goal there will be a comments section where you can ask questions about the post as well as communicate with the seller about delivery details (i.e. pick up location, shipping costs, ect.)

## Future Features
* In the future I would like to build out my user cart and add a payment feature that takes the buyers card info and returns a recipt. I also want to add a comments/questions section, or some way for the users to communicate to the seller.
